Link0\Profiler
==============

This library acts as a layer over XHProf profiling, and persisting profiles for later analysis.

The code is quite new, so please report any bugs if you encounter them, even though unit-tests cover 100% of the code.

All ideas are welcome, and contributers as well.

TODO
=====
- Implement listing and saving an index into the PersistenceHandler.
- Build a webapp that parses the profiles.
- Add more PersistenceHandlers (like Filesystem or Mysql for example).
